# Wild_Fire_Detection_model
Introduction:

- This repository contains code for a wildfire detection model built using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. The model is designed to detect the presence of 
 wildfires in satellite imagery with a high degree of accuracy. The model uses a combination of a pre-trained MobileNet and a custom convolutional neural network to achieve an 
 accuracy of 96% on the test dataset.
